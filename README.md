# Text-to-Dance Video

## Overview  
This is a fun project that generates a Just Dance-style video for any song. Users can provide a YouTube video link, the project extracts the audio, generates dance moves from Just Dance videos available online, and creates a custom dance video synchronized with the music and beats.

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following command:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/partharora1105/Text-to-dance.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
There is also a setup.sh file that creates a conda environment if needed

## Usage  
To use the project, open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Run all cells in the notebook. In the last cell, provide the YouTube video link. The project will automatically download the generated Just Dance-style video once it completes.
